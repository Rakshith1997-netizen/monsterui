# 🧟 MonsterUI

**MonsterUI** is a sleek and fast UI toolkit built using `monsterui` and `python-fasthtml`, designed for building ultra-lightweight Python GUI apps. This project features two sample applications:

- 📋 `todo_app.py` – A simple To-Do List app
- 🔢 `counter_app.py` – A basic Counter app

Both apps are managed using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a fast Python package manager.
